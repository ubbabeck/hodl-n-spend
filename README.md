I have runned bitcoin core version 22.0.0 for this assigment.

## Run task1.py
Use params to run this script
```
python task1.py bitcoinaddress timelock
```
## Run task2.py
Insert the private keys in the script

```
python task2.py

Please let me know if I made any security mistakes or if there is a better way 
of solving the task than how I did it. 

This assessment was demanding, but I learned a lot from it.

Best,
